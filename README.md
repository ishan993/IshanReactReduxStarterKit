A React and Redux Starter kit built from FacebookIncubator's Create-React-App kit
                       so I don't have to start from scratch every time.               

It includes the following libraries on top of React starter kit:

 Redux (duh!)

 React-Redux

 Glamourous (for component styling)

 React-Router (latest: v4 at the time of writing this)

Instructions to run it:

1. Install all the dependencies by running: npm install
2. Start the server by running: npm start
